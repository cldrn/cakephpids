PHPIDS plugin for CakePHP
------------------------------
PHPIDS (PHP-Intrusion Detection System) is a state-of-the-art security layer for your PHP based web application written by Mario Heiderich.

The IDS neither strips, sanitizes nor filters any malicious input, it simply recognizes when an attacker tries to break your site and reacts in exactly the way you want it to. PHPIDS is by far the best open source Intrusion Detection System for PHP right now. Don't forget to read its documentation to take full advantage of its power.(*)
